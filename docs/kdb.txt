Kinetic Database 
================

One of the bottlenecks in an aKMC simulation is performing the saddle point 
searches.  The kinetic database is used to ameliorate this cost by 
storing information about processes as they are found and using it to predict 
future saddle points.

In the following figure, the hydrogen of a carboxyl group on an Au(111) surface 
transfers to the other oxygen (a). In this process, the hydrogen is determined 
to be the only moving atom, and the two oxygen atoms to be its neighbors. The 
other atoms are stripped from the system and the resulting configurations are 
stored in the database (b). If in the future the system passes through a state 
with a local configuration closely resembling either minimum of (b), the 
kinetic database will suggest a saddle to converge with a dimer search. The 
dimer starts with this suggested configuration and mode, and if it is a good 
suggestion, converges very rapidly to the saddle.

Dependencies
------------

The kinetic database is contained in a library seperate from eOn. It can be found in our 
*tsase* Python module located `here <http://theory.cm.utexas.edu/tsase>`_.

[KDB] Options
-------------

**use_kdb**: Turn KDB on/off.

    type: boolean

    default: ``False``

**remove_duplicates**: KDB will not make duplicate suggestions. This can slow KDB querying, so it may be best to use this only for slow potentials (DFT, etc.).

    type: boolean

    default: ``False``

**kdb_only**: Only use kdb in an akmc simulation, no random searches.

    type: boolean

    default: ``False``
