Process Search
==============

The AKMC method can ask clients to do a saddle search, find connecting minima, and calculate prefactors all within the Process Search job type.

[Process Search] Options
-------------------------

**minimization_offset**: After a saddle is found, images are placed on either
side of the saddle along the mode and minimized to ensure that the saddle is
connected to the original minimum and to locate the product state. This is the
distance those images are displaced from the saddle.

    type: float

    default: ``[Optimizer] max_move``

**minimize_first**: Every time a process search is run by a client the reactant
will be minimized first before doing any saddle searches.

    type: boolean

    default: ``True``
