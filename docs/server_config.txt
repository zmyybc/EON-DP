Server configuration
================================

The eOn server uses a single configuration file, config.ini. The format of the
file is the *.ini* format. The *.ini* format consists of sections, keys, and
values.  Each section header is surrounded by square brackets, and is followed
by the key/value pairs. For example, to set the *temperature* key of the 
*[akmc]* section to the value *450*, your config.ini file would include the 
lines:

.. code-block:: none

    [akmc]
    temperature = 450
